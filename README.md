## Developer Manual (Client)

### Recommended Extensions (VSC)
Here's a list of extensions that I recommend installing

### Best Practices

##### File Types
If you're writing a React component, make it a .jsx file! .js will compile just fine, but the styling is a little less friendly.

HTML styling should be written in SASS, rather than CSS. .scss files are easily importable and more readable.

##### File System
As a general rule, the file system should be kept as "modular" as possible. For example, components referenced by App.jsx go in src/components, but components only referenced by Login.jsx are kepy in src/components/login. Assets follow the same rule (src/assets has global assets. src/components/topbar/assets has assets only used by Topbar.jsx).

##### Comment your code!
Try to make it really clear what it is that you're doing. Even code that you wrote 6 months ago can feel totally foreign without proper documentation.
Follow this guide to creating function signatures.
Shortcut: typing "/**" one line above a function and hitting enter will auto-generate a signature template.
```js
/**
* Multiply two numbers together
* @param x {Number} the first number
* @param y {Number} the second number
* @returns {Number} the product of x and y
*/
function multiplyTwoNumbers(x, y) {
    return x * y;
}
```

##### Document! Document! Document!
Write out what you're doing in README.md so that anyone else can (hopefully) look up whatever they need.

##### Local Storage Usage
Local storage should only ever have items that are currently relevant. login:phone_number, for example, is only necessary during the login process between entering a user's phone number and getting the userId. Once it has done it's job, it should be removed.
```js
localStorage.removeItem('login:phone_number');
``` 

Also, take note of the name attached to the item. Since phone_number (in this context, at least) is only relevant to login, it's prefixed by "login:". This should make it easy to determine which components are leaking local storage items if there's even an issue.

### Routing
The best way to write connected pages is to make efficient use of the ReactDOM router, parent components, and the browser's localStorage.

Routes work like a switch statement that returns a component based on the current window.location. Components outside the Routes tag will not be effected by the url.

Take a look at how routing works in Login.jsx:
```jsx
<Routes>
  <Route path="/" element={<PhoneInput />}/>
  <Route path="/phone-number" element={<PhoneInput />}/>
  <Route path="/authentication/*" element={<Authentication setUserById={setUserById}/>}/>
  <Route path="/account-creation" element={<NewUserForm setUserById={setUserById}/>}/>
</Routes>
```
Notice that, even though we're doing user authentication, the phone number, user id, etc. are not being passed into child component. Code looks much cleaner (and is therefore easier to adapt/refactor) when localStorage is used to keep these variables. There's also the added benefit of not losing values on page refresh!

Take note of the asterisk after /authentication. This means that there are more routes contained within /authentication. Forgetting to add the asterisk in the parent route will 
```js
<Route path="/authentication/*" element={<Authentication setUserById={setUserById}/>}/>
```
And inside the Authentication component...
```js
<Routes>
    <Route path="/" element={<AuthCodeInput />} />
    <Route path="/check-auth" element={<AuthCodeInput />} />
    <Route path="/fetch-user" element={<FetchUser />} />
    <Route path="/password-entry" element={<PasswordEntry setUserById={setUserById}/>}/>
</Routes>
```

It's also helpful to include an element for the "/" path. This can be the same as some other path, like shown above, or different.

### The API Folder
Some custom APIs have been created for to make certain actions more consistent / simpler to implement.

##### Axios API
axios.js just sets the baseUrl for GET/POST requests. 
```js
// Don't import from 'axios'! We want our version!
import axios from '/api/axios'
```

##### Formatter API
formatter.js sets default currency formatter settings
```js
import formatter from '/api/formatter'
formatter.format(200) // Returns "$200.00"
```

### Displaying Notifications
Notifications are displayed in the NotificationContainer that lies outside the routes in App.js. Notifications can be created by any component and will display as an overlay on the entire application. 

In order to create a notitification, NotificationManager must be imported.
```js
import NotificationManager from 'react-notifications';
```

After it has been imported, notifications can be displayed by calling the following functions.
```js
NotificationManager.success("This one is green!", "Notification title...");
NotificationManager.info("This one is blue!", "It can have a different title, too!");
NotificationManager.warning("This one is orange.", "Maybe not the worst thing, but we thought we'd let you know.");
NotificationManager.error("This one is red!", "The sky is falling!");
```

There are a few other props, but they are currently unused in this application: timeOut, callback, and priority.
The order is as follows: NotificationManager.success(message, title, timeOut, callback, priority);
```js
NotificationManager.warning('Warning message', 'Close after 3000ms', 3000);                         // Closes after 3 seconds
NotificationManager.error('Error message', 'Click me!', 5000, () => { console.log("Ouch!"); });     // Closes after 5 seconds and has an on-click event
NotificationManager.error('High priority', 'Title', 1000, () => {}, true);                          // Priority is a booleanâ€” high priority notifications are displayed at the top
```
